feat(dev-experience): comprehensive .gitignore reorganization

Why:
- The existing .gitignore was poorly organized and missing important patterns for the monorepo structure with Next.js, TypeScript, and testing frameworks.

What:
- Reorganized .gitignore with clear sections (Node, Next.js, TypeScript, Build outputs, Testing, IDE, Env, OS, Logs, Misc)
- Added missing patterns for monorepo structure (**/node_modules/, **/dist/, **/build/)
- Enhanced testing patterns (.playwright/, **/test-results/)
- Added IDE support (.idea/, .vscode/)
- Improved environment file handling (.env.* with !.env.example exception)
- Added modern tooling patterns (.turbo/, better log patterns)

Impact:
- Better organization and maintainability of ignore patterns
- Prevents accidental commits of build artifacts, logs, and IDE files across the monorepo
- Clearer separation of concerns with sectioned organization
- Reduced repository bloat from ignored files

Cost:
- tokens: ~same (configuration only)
- runtime: ~same (no runtime impact)
- storage: ~same (prevents unnecessary files)

MCP:
- search "gitignore patterns monorepo organization"
- add_episode Procedure "Use comprehensive .gitignore with clear sections for monorepo projects including Node, Next.js, TypeScript, testing, IDE, and environment patterns"
