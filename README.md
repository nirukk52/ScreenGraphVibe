# ScreenGraphVibe

**AI-driven crawling and verification system for mobile and web apps.**

Automatically explores applications, captures UI states and actions as structured graphs (Screengraphs), and compares them against own baselines and competetion apps.

## üåü North Star Vision

ScreenGraphVibe aims to revolutionize mobile and web competation analysis:
To do this building a reliable screengraph of any app is crucial.

- **Intelligent Exploration**: Automatically discover and map all UI states and user flows
- **Visual Verification**: Capture and compare UI states against baselines with AI-powered analysis
- **Graph-Based Testing**: Represent app behavior as structured graphs (Screengraphs) for comprehensive coverage
- **Multi-Platform**: Support for both mobile (iOS/Android via Appium) and web applications
- **Baseline Comparison**: Detect UI regressions and unexpected behavior changes automatically
- **LangGraph Orchestration**: AI-driven test strategy and adaptive exploration

This is our long-term vision. We're building incrementally toward this goal with focused, testable features.

## üöÄ Project Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- PostgreSQL database (Supabase recommended)
- Python 3.9+ (for Appium agent)

### Quick Setup

```bash
# 1. Clone and install dependencies
git clone https://github.com/nirukk52/ScreenGraphVibe.git
cd ScreenGraphVibe
npm install

# 2. Setup environment variables
cp env.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local with your credentials (see docs/CREDENTIALS.md)

# 3. Setup database
npm run db:generate
npm run db:migrate

# 4. Start everything
./scripts/start.sh local
```

**‚úÖ Done!** Services will be running at:
- üîß Backend API ‚Üí http://localhost:3000
- üé® UI Dashboard ‚Üí http://localhost:3001

**Stop services:** `./scripts/stop.sh`

## üß™ Testing

### Quick Start

```bash
# Run all tests (GOD COMMAND)
npm run test:all

# Run all tests in all modules
npm test

# Run tests by type
npm run test:unit        # All unit tests
npm run test:integration # All integration tests
npm run test:e2e         # E2E tests only
```

### Module-Specific Testing

```bash
# Test individual modules
npm run test:data        # Data layer tests
npm run test:backend     # Backend API tests
npm run test:ui          # UI component tests
npm run test:agent       # Python agent tests

# Test specific type in module
npm run test:data:unit           # Data unit tests only
npm run test:backend:integration # Backend integration tests only
npm run test:ui:unit             # UI unit tests only
```

### Development Mode

```bash
# Watch mode for TDD
cd data && npm run test:watch
cd backend && npm run test:watch
cd ui && npm run test:watch
```

### Test Status

| Test Type | Status | Count |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Unit Tests | ‚úÖ Passing | 25+ tests |
| Integration Tests | ‚úÖ Passing | 10+ tests |
| E2E Tests | ‚úÖ Passing | 2 tests |
| Health Checks | ‚úÖ Working | All Green |
