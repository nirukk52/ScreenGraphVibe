# ScreenGraphVibe

**AI-driven crawling and verification system for mobile and web apps.**

Automatically explores applications, captures UI states and actions as structured graphs (Screengraphs), and compares them against own baselines and competetion apps.

## 🌟 North Star Vision

ScreenGraphVibe aims to revolutionize mobile and web competation analysis:
To do this building a reliable screengraph of any app is crucial.

- **Intelligent Exploration**: Automatically discover and map all UI states and user flows
- **Visual Verification**: Capture and compare UI states against baselines with AI-powered analysis
- **Graph-Based Testing**: Represent app behavior as structured graphs (Screengraphs) for comprehensive coverage
- **Multi-Platform**: Support for both mobile (iOS/Android via Appium) and web applications
- **Baseline Comparison**: Detect UI regressions and unexpected behavior changes automatically
- **LangGraph Orchestration**: AI-driven test strategy and adaptive exploration

This is our long-term vision. We're building incrementally toward this goal with focused, testable features.

## 🚀 Project Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- PostgreSQL database (Supabase recommended)
- Python 3.9+ (for Appium agent)

### Quick Setup

```bash
# 1. Clone and install dependencies
git clone https://github.com/nirukk52/ScreenGraphVibe.git
cd ScreenGraphVibe
npm install

# 2. Setup environment variables
cp env.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local with your credentials (see docs/CREDENTIALS.md)

# 3. Setup database
npm run db:generate
npm run db:migrate

# 4. Start everything
./scripts/start.sh local
```

**✅ Done!** Services will be running at:
- 🔧 Backend API → http://localhost:3000
- 🎨 UI Dashboard → http://localhost:3001

**Stop services:** `./scripts/stop.sh`

## 🧪 Testing Setup

### Run All Tests
```bash
npm test
```

### Run Specific Test Suites
```bash
# Unit tests only
npm run test:unit --workspace=tests

# Integration tests
npm run test:integration --workspace=tests

# End-to-end tests (requires services running)
npm run test:e2e --workspace=tests
```

### Test Status
