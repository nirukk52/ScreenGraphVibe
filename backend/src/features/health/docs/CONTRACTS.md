# Contracts

- Feature exec response schema: `features/health/schemas/exec-response.schema.ts`
- Sub-feature contracts:
  - Health Check request: `features/health/check/schemas/request.schema.ts`
  - Health Check response: `features/health/check/schemas/response.schema.ts`

The sub-feature route is wired with a response schema for OpenAPI.
