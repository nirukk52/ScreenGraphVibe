# Retro Log - Persona Management Dashboard

## Conflict Analysis: 2025-10-11T05:15

### Conflict Count
**11 files** with add/add conflicts when merging `origin/main` into `feature/persona-management-dashboard`

### Root Cause
**Dual-path code delivery**: Same files created via two different mechanisms:
1. **Direct GitHub push** (PRs #61-67, #69-70) - Created files on remote branches only
2. **Local workspace** (feature/persona-management-dashboard) - Created files locally with complete implementation

When PRs #61-67 were merged to main, they brought **placeholder/stub versions** of the same files.
When attempting to merge main back into feature branch, Git detected **add/add conflicts** (both branches added same files independently).

### Affected Files
```
backend/src/features/management/codeowners/routes.ts
backend/src/features/management/personas/routes.ts
backend/src/index.ts
ui/src/features/management/persona-management/components/*.tsx (6 files)
ui/src/features/management/persona-management/index.ts
ui/src/pages/management/persona-management.tsx
```

### Why This Happened
1. **Hybrid workflow**: Mixed MCP GitHub direct push with local Git workflow
2. **Placeholder PRs**: Created branches with minimal placeholders to "open PRs early"
3. **User merged PRs**: Placeholders landed in main before feature branch
4. **Convergence conflict**: Feature branch has complete implementation, main has stubs

### Impact
- ‚è±Ô∏è Time lost: ~10 minutes to resolve conflicts
- üîÄ Developer confusion: "Where's the code?"
- üß™ Test complexity: E2E passed locally but remote branches had incomplete code
- üìä Diff noise: PR #71 shows conflicts with own placeholder commits

### Prevention Strategy
**Always local-first workflow**:
1. ‚úÖ Create feature branch locally
2. ‚úÖ Write code in local workspace
3. ‚úÖ Commit locally (triggers hooks)
4. ‚úÖ Push to remote
5. ‚úÖ Open PR only when ready
6. ‚ùå NEVER use `mcp_github_push_files` for actual implementation
7. ‚ùå NEVER merge placeholder PRs before feature branch

### Resolution
Accept "ours" (local feature branch) for all conflicts since it contains complete, tested implementation.

```bash
git checkout --ours <file>  # for each conflict
git add <file>
git commit
```

### Lesson Learned
**MCP GitHub tools are for GitHub operations** (issues, PRs, comments), **NOT for writing code**.
Code must flow through local workspace ‚Üí git ‚Üí GitHub to maintain developer experience and tooling integrity.

### Action Items
- [ ] Update CLAUDE.md to clarify: "NEVER use mcp_github_push_files for implementation"
- [ ] Document in Graphiti: "local-first workflow is mandatory"
- [ ] Add to persona BEFORE_TASK: "verify local workspace has code"
